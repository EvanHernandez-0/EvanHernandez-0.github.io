    "summary": "I'm a hands-on developer with an A.A.S. in Computer Programming (3.6 GPA) and a real passion for building things that work — and work well. I’ve had practical experience with full-stack development, object-oriented programming, and troubleshooting everything from code to hardware. My go-to tools include C#, C++, Python, and PHP, and I’ve built everything from web apps with database backends to task automation scripts. I pick up new tech quickly, write clean and reliable code, and genuinely enjoy solving problems. I'm excited to bring that energy to a development team where I can keep learning, contribute to meaningful projects, and help build reliable, effective tech solutions.",
